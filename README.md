# 🚀 Silus: GitHub & Railway Deployment Plan

You've uploaded the Silus app to GitHub — awesome!

## ✅ Step 1: GitHub Setup Complete
GitHub repo is live and ready to deploy.

## 🚀 Step 2: Railway Deployment (Next Up)
1. [Go to Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub Repo**
3. Select the Silus repo you just uploaded
4. Railway will auto-detect the config:
   - Reads `railway.json`
   - Installs dependencies
   - Deploys backend

## ⚙️ Add Environment Variable
1. In Railway > Project > Variables:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-secret-key`

2. Click **Deploy** or wait for auto-deploy

3. Once deployed, copy the live link (e.g., `https://silus.up.railway.app`)
